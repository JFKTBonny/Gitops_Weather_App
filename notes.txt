############## k8s Security:
           k8s while robust and scalable , presents a unique set of security challenges that sterm from its dynamic and distributed nature...
           Security in k8s clusters involves safeguarding: 
                                             - the infra the apps are running on 
                                             - the data that it processes
                       k8s  Security  keys components are:
                                    -  Authentication and Authorization: 
                                           only verified users can access the cluster with method such as certificates and tokens...
                                           users actions are controlled through RBAC nd ABAC(Attributed-Based Access Control)...
                                    - API security :
                                           the API server is the central control unit of any k8s cluster...
                                           Security access to the API involves using:
                                                              1 - SSL/TLS encryption
                                                              2- API request auditing
                                                              3- limiting IP access through network policies...
                                    - Network security: 
                                              Enforcing policies that control the flow of traffic between pods and externalnetworks helps:
                                                 - prevent unauthorized access..
                                                 - limits IP the potential for lateral movement within the cluster...    
                                    - Pod security admission:
                                              This is a k8s admmission controller that enforces security settings on pods at creation time using predefined security profiles:
                                                          - privileged
                                                          - baseline
                                                          - restricted to ensure compliance with best practices and prevent privilege escallations...
                                    - Secrets management:
                                               K8s manages sensitives data(such as password and tokens) using secrets..
